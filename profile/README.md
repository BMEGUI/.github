This project is dedicated to the development of BMEGUI, which is a set of software utilities providing a Graphical Users Interface (GUI) to the Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) advanced functions of Space/Time geostatistical analysis. Using this software, the user has access to an easy-to-use interface for the analysis of space/time data.
